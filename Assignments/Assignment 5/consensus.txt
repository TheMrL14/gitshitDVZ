From this graph we can conclude that there is indeed a correlation between the total amount of sunlight and the total amount of alcohol consumed in a country. In the countries where the sun shines less the alcohol consumption is higher than in counties where there is more sunlight.  In this graph things like poverty and religion aren’t involved but I think those are elements that also effect the alcohol consumption.
