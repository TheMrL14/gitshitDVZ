Assignment 1 -Twitter API-
This interactive visual shows the activity of the most trending twitter topic. Every time someone tweets about the topic a new cell is born. A new cell can either born alone or can be a separation from an other cell.  

Assignment 2 -Last seconds of WOI- 
This simple yet effective visualisation shows the surrealistic reality of the last seconds of world war I.It is inspired by recreated audio footage from that exact moment. Which is used and visualised by a red poppy being born and formed by the data from the sound fragment.

Assignment 3 -Nicolas Cage Movies-
This linear chart displays the career of Hollywood movie star Nicolas Cage.It is a nice visualisation of his diverse career starting in 1973 and really shows that no role is negligible for the actor.

Assignment 4 -Imagine-
This 3D printed object is created to investigate the patterns in music. With John Lennonâ€™s Imagine I chose an all-time classic for this one. Every Bar displays a note in the song, the higher the note, the higher the bar.

Assignment 5 -Tequila sunlight-
This bar chart is an exploratory work to investigate the correlation between sunlight and alcohol consumption. From this chart we can conclude that there is indeed a correlation between the total amount of sunlight and the total amount of alcohol consumed in a country. In the countries where the sun shines less the alcohol consumption is higher than in counties where there is more sunlight.
